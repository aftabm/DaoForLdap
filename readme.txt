DAO FOR LDAP
------------------

A light weight library for multitenancy authentication and LDAP CURED operations.  

* Dynamically configurable.
* Provides authentication services.
* Provides CRUD operation for Tenants, Roles, and Users.
* Provide bulk importer to import data from CVS file to LDAP.
* Layered architecture provide flexibility for extension. 
* Comprehensive unit tests via embedded LDAP.


TO RUN UNIT TESTS
------------------
There are two way to run unit test

1- with embedded LDAP.
	- mvn test -Dtest="AllTests".
	- This will launch Apache embedded LDAP server and will do the bootstrapping.
	- You can use ApacheDs studio or Eclipse plugin to browse the server contents 
	  during the execution of the tests. Followings are configurations for the connection: 
	  
	  	Hostname="localhost"
		Port="1024"
		encryption method="no encryption"
		Authentication Method = "Simple"
		Authentication Parameters 
		Bind DN = "uid=admin,ou=system"
		Bind Password = "secret"
	  

2- Stand alone ApacheDs LDAP server. 
	- Create partition into your server. Configuration is provided in "easy_ldap_server.xml".
	- Import "easy-ldap.ldif" schema into your LDAP server.
	- Open "ldap-context-test.properties". Change the server port to 10389  
	- mvn test -Dtest="AllTests"
